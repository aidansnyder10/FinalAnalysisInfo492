Team 2 — Finance— Offense
Course: INFO 498B — Agentic Cybersecurity with AI & LLMs
Team: <Team 2 — Aidan Snyder: aidan10, PUT REST OF YOUR NAMES HERE>

One-line pitch: We as team two wanted to test the role of Agentic Systems when generating phishing attacks against financial institutions. Many individuals are victims of social engineering, and we wanted to see how powerful AI models were when it came to creating and sending these messages autonomously.


1) Live Demo
Synthetic Industry: [Demo](http://65.21.55.44:3000/agent-monitor.html)> — status: UP — test creds (fake): none


Agentic System: same as above — status: Up — notes: <Using 3 Models: Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, Claude 3 Haiku>




2) Thesis & Outcome
Original thesis (week 2): <1–2 sentences>


Final verdict: <True / False / Partially true>


Why (top evidence):


<Evidence 1>


<Evidence 2>


<Evidence 3>


3) What We Built
Synthetic industry: API server with endpoints for email deployment, metrics tracking, and user engagement simulation. Also includes roles for Bank Admin and Hacker.


Agentic system:  We have an attack agent that autonomously generates and deploys phishing emails targeting specific personas from Models listed above. The defense agent analyzes incoming emails using ML decision tree classifier, blocks/reports suspicious emails, and a strategy trainer which is a  self-learning system that tracks strategy performance and persona vulnerabilities. We evaluated our attacks with Real-time metrics tracking (bypass rates, click rates, detection rates), performance trends visualization, strategy effectiveness scoring.


Key risks addressed (or exercised): Phishing email attacks targeting financial institution employees, Social engineering via email, URL spoofing and domain impersonation, Email-based credential theft attempts, Adaptive attack strategies that learn from defense responses


4) Roles, Auth, Data
Roles & permissions: Admin - Full dashboard access, customer management, transaction monitoring, fraud detection, system health monitoring. Hacker - launch spearphishing campaigns, target specific personas, choose type and severity of attack. Customer - View own account, transactions, email inbox. Business Customer - B2B banking features, business email portal


Authentication: Fake credential-based authentication with hardcoded credentials in script.js, Multi-factor authentication (2FA) simulation with static codes, Session management via localStorage (no real security), Role-based access control enforced in frontend JavaScript, Agent system uses API endpoints with no authentication (internal only)


Data: synthetic only; generator + brief schema description: Synthetic only - All data is generated and fake

Banking data generator: Creates synthetic customers, accounts, transactions, fraud alerts via supabase-schema.sql and demo data in script.js
Email data generator: Phishing emails generated by attack agent using LLM prompts, stored in bank-inbox.json
Persona generator: Pre-defined personas with names, roles, and vulnerability profiles for targeted attacks
Schema: JSON files for metrics/storage, Supabase PostgreSQL schema for banking data, in-memory events array for user engagement tracking


5) Experiments Summary (Demos #3 - #5)
Demo #3: <hypothesis> — <setup> — Result: <pass/fail + one sentence> — Evidence: <link/note>


Demo #4 (continuous run): uptime <xx.x%>, incidents <n>, Improvement observed: <yes/no + brief>


Demo #5 (final): <what was validated> — Result: <one sentence> — Evidence: <link/note>


6) Key Results (plain text)
Effectiveness: <e.g., detection/attack success %, MTTR trend>


Reliability: <uptime / error patterns>


Safety: <policy violations blocked, guardrails that mattered>


7) How to Use / Deploy
Prereqs: <accounts, env vars, keys (fake for lab), storage>


Deploy steps: see docs/deploy.md


Test steps: see docs/test-plan.md


8) Safety, Ethics, Limits
Synthetic data only; no real credentials or org systems.


Controls: <role gating, throttling, sandboxing, policy checks>.


Known limits/failure modes: <brief list>.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
3. **Use the demo credentials** above to login
4. **Explore the admin dashboard**

## Supabase Integration (Optional)

To use real database functionality:

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Note your project URL and anon key

### 2. Set Up the Database

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL to create all tables and sample data
