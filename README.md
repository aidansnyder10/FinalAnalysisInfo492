Team 2 — Finance— Offense
Course: INFO 498B — Agentic Cybersecurity with AI & LLMs
Team: <Team 2 — Aidan Snyder: aidan10, Phoebe Dong: dongpp, PUT REST OF YOUR NAMES HERE>

One-line pitch: We as team two wanted to test the role of Agentic Systems when generating phishing attacks against financial institutions. Many individuals are victims of social engineering, and we wanted to see how powerful AI models were when it came to creating and sending these messages autonomously.


1) Live Demo
Synthetic Industry: [Demo](http://65.21.55.44:3000/agent-monitor.html)> — status: UP — test creds (fake): none


Agentic System: same as above — status: Up — notes: <Using 3 Models: Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, Claude 3 Haiku>




2) Thesis & Outcome
Original thesis (week 2): <1–2 sentences>


Final verdict: <True / False / Partially true>


Why (top evidence):


<Evidence 1>


<Evidence 2>


<Evidence 3>


3) What We Built
Synthetic industry: API server with endpoints for email deployment, metrics tracking, and user engagement simulation. Also includes roles for Bank Admin and Hacker.


Agentic system:  We have an attack agent that autonomously generates and deploys phishing emails targeting specific personas from Models listed above. The defense agent analyzes incoming emails using ML decision tree classifier, blocks/reports suspicious emails, and a strategy trainer which is a  self-learning system that tracks strategy performance and persona vulnerabilities. We evaluated our attacks with Real-time metrics tracking (bypass rates, click rates, detection rates), performance trends visualization, strategy effectiveness scoring.


Key risks addressed (or exercised): Phishing email attacks targeting financial institution employees, Social engineering via email, URL spoofing and domain impersonation, Email-based credential theft attempts, Adaptive attack strategies that learn from defense responses


4) Roles, Auth, Data
Roles & permissions: Admin - Full dashboard access, customer management, transaction monitoring, fraud detection, system health monitoring. Hacker - launch spearphishing campaigns, target specific personas, choose type and severity of attack. Customer - View own account, transactions, email inbox. Business Customer - B2B banking features, business email portal


Authentication: Fake credential-based authentication with hardcoded credentials in script.js, Multi-factor authentication (2FA) simulation with static codes, Session management via localStorage (no real security), Role-based access control enforced in frontend JavaScript, Agent system uses API endpoints with no authentication (internal only)


Data: synthetic only; generator + brief schema description: Synthetic only - All data is generated and fake

Banking data generator: Creates synthetic customers, accounts, transactions, fraud alerts via supabase-schema.sql and demo data in script.js
Email data generator: Phishing emails generated by attack agent using LLM prompts, stored in bank-inbox.json
Persona generator: Pre-defined personas with names, roles, and vulnerability profiles for targeted attacks
Schema: JSON files for metrics/storage, Supabase PostgreSQL schema for banking data, in-memory events array for user engagement tracking


5) Experiments Summary (Demos #3 - #5)
Demo #3: <hypothesis> — <setup> — Result: <pass/fail + one sentence> — Evidence: <link/note>


Demo #4 (continuous run): uptime <xx.x%>, incidents <n>, Improvement observed: <yes/no + brief>


Demo #5 (final): <what was validated> — Result: <one sentence> — Evidence: <link/note>


6) Key Results (plain text)
Effectiveness: The agentic attacker continued to show strong performance during the updated Demo 4 run. Across current 91 attack cycles, the system generated 268 emails, with a 98.2% generation success rate (268 success, 5 failed). Out of 504 total defense interactions, 366 emails bypassed defenses (a 72.6% bypass rate) and 28 were clicked, giving a 7.7% click rate. These numbers show that most AI-generated emails not only landed in the inbox but also stayed convincing enough to get real engagement. Self-training results also showed improvement in strategy effectiveness, with the top models hitting ~79% bypass rates under high-urgency attacks.


Reliability: The system stayed stable for the full 48-hour continuous run, with almost no downtime and minimal errors during email generation. The dashboards updated consistently, attack logs recorded correctly, and the self-training loop kept running on schedule. No major crashes or data loss happened during testing.


Safety: All actions remained restricted to our synthetic environment. Role-based access prevented cross-dashboard misuse, and the system enforced guardrails on generation (no harmful or out-of-scope content). Defense filters still surfaced detection events clearly, and the sandboxing ensured all emails, metrics, and personas stayed inside the controlled demo environment.


7) How to Use / Deploy
Prereqs: <accounts, env vars, keys (fake for lab), storage>


Deploy steps: see docs/deploy.md


Test steps: see docs/test-plan.md


8) Safety, Ethics, Limits
Synthetic data only; no real credentials or org systems.
Everything — personas, emails, dashboards, logs — is fully fake and contained. The system never interacts with real networks or external users.


Controls: Role gating keeps hacker and admin actions separate. Sandboxing restricts all activity to safe demo pages. Throttling limits how fast emails are generated. Policy checks inside prompts stop the LLM from going outside acceptable content.


Known limits/failure modes: The defense side is simpler than a real bank, so bypass rates don’t perfectly reflect real-world filtering. The AI attacker can occasionally hallucinate details or push urgency too hard. Self-training improves tone and personalization, but it still can’t simulate full real-world threat-intel cycles. Overall, the system is strong as a demo, but not a production-level model of real financial security.
